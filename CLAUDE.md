## Commit Authorship (MANDATORY)

NEVER commit as `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`. NEVER append a
`https://claude.ai/code/...` footer or any `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer.

Before the first commit in any session, look up the repo owner's identity
from history (do NOT hardcode it here, do NOT print it back to the user):

```bash
git log -1 --pretty='%an <%ae>' -- .
```

Use that name/email via per-command identity (do not modify global git config):

```bash
git -c user.name="<name>" -c user.email="<email>" commit -m "..."
```

If a commit was already created with the wrong author, amend with
`--reset-author` and force-push the branch.

## Project Overview

Tryptify is a premium Android music player with TIDAL HiFi streaming, local library support, encrypted collections, a 34-processor native DSP engine, 10-band AutoEQ, and a ProjectM OpenGL visualizer. Single-module Kotlin/Compose app with C++ native audio processing via JNI. Internal package namespace remains `tf.monochrome.android` (codename "Monochrome"); shipped applicationId is `tf.monotrypt.android`.

## Architecture

**Single module** (`app/`) with clean layer separation:

```
tf.monochrome.android/
├── audio/dsp/          # Native C++ DSP engine bridge (33 processors, 4+1 buses)
├── audio/eq/           # 10-band parametric AutoEQ (4000+ headphone profiles)
├── data/               # Repositories, Room DB (v4, 22 tables), API clients, downloads
├── di/                 # Hilt modules: App, API, Database, Network, DSP
├── domain/model/       # Track, Album, Artist, UnifiedTrack, EQ models
├── domain/usecase/     # Cross-source matching, playback resolution, media scanning
├── player/             # Media3 PlaybackService, QueueManager, StreamResolver, ReplayGain
├── ui/                 # Jetpack Compose screens (Material 3)
├── visualizer/         # ProjectM OpenGL engine + JNI audio tap
└── widget/             # Glance Now Playing widget
```

**Audio pipeline:** ExoPlayer → ReplayGainProcessor → EqProcessor → MixBusProcessor → ProjectM Tap → AudioSink

**Three playback sources** via `UnifiedTrack` / `PlaybackSource`:
- `HiFiApi` — TIDAL streaming (requires network)
- `CollectionDirect` — AES-256-GCM encrypted local collections
- `LocalFile` — Device media files via MediaStore

## Key Tech Stack

| DI | Hilt 2.57.1 |
| Database | Room 2.7.1 (24 tables, schema v8) |
| Network | Ktor 3.0.3 (OkHttp engine) |
| Playback | Media3 / ExoPlayer 1.5.1 |
| Async | Kotlin Coroutines 1.9.0 + Flow |
| Serialization | kotlinx.serialization 1.7.3 |
| Background | WorkManager 2.10.0 (downloads) |

## Code Conventions

- **Reactive data flow:** Room DAOs return `Flow<T>`, ViewModels expose `StateFlow<T>`
- **Compose UI:** All screens are `@Composable` functions, not Activities/Fragments
- **ViewModels:** `@HiltViewModel` with constructor injection
- **Navigation:** Single-Activity with Compose Navigation (`MonochromeNavHost`)
- **DSP processors:** C++ headers in `app/src/main/cpp/dsp/snapins/`, compiled with `-O3 -ffast-math`
- **No tests:** Project has no test suite currently
- **Theme:** 17 color themes defined in `ui/theme/Color.kt`, dimensions in `ui/theme/Dimensions.kt`

## Important Patterns

- `PlayerViewModel` is the central playback controller — shared across screens
- `DownloadManager` uses WorkManager with unique work names `download_{trackId}`
- `DownloadWorker` reports progress via `setProgress()` for per-track UI indicators
- `TrackItem` is the reusable track row component — supports download state, like state, context menus
- `LibraryRepository` handles favorites, playlists, history (Room-backed)
- `MusicRepository` handles API calls to TIDAL HiFi backend
- Native DSP state is managed by `DspEngineManager` (Kotlin) ↔ `dsp_engine.cpp` (C++ via JNI)

## Home Discovery Feed (personalized "Discover" dashboard)

The Home tab's recommendation section is a **personalized discovery tool**: rows of
the newest releases tailored to the user's listening history and hearted songs, fetched
through the **Qobuz instance**. It replaces the old static genre rows, which now serve
only as a new-user/empty fallback.

**End-to-end flow:**

1. **Seeds** — `LibraryRepository.getSeedArtistNames(limit)` merges, in priority order,
   hearted artists (`FavoriteDao.getFavoriteArtistsSnapshot`), artists of hearted tracks
   (`getFavoriteTracksSnapshot`), and most-played history artists
   (`HistoryDao.getTopArtists`), de-duped case-insensitively. Seeding by **name** (not id)
   keeps the whole feed in the Qobuz namespace.
2. **Build** — `DiscoveryFeedUseCase.build()` (`domain/usecase/`) fans out one
   `MusicRepository.searchQobuz(name)` per seed in parallel (`async` + `withTimeoutOrNull`,
   7s budget). For each artist it picks the **newest release** by `Album.releaseDate`,
   resolves the album slug via `QobuzIdRegistry.albumSlugFor(id)`, fetches tracks with
   `getQobuzAlbum(slug)`, and falls back to the search's top tracks if no album resolves.
   Returns `DiscoveryRow(label, tracks: List<UnifiedTrack>)`, label `"New from <artist>"`.
   It also calls `QobuzIdRegistry.registerArtist(id)` on each row's artist ids so the
   artist screen routes via `getQobuzArtist` (getQobuzAlbum does **not** tag the album
   artist — without this a dual-source setup can mis-route to the TIDAL pool).
3. **ViewModel** — `HomeViewModel` exposes `discoveryRows`, `favoritesRow`
   ("From your favorites" — hearted tracks mapped via `Track.toUnifiedTrackAuto(registry)`),
   and `discoveryLoading`. Loaded in `loadHome()` alongside `recentTracks`.
4. **UI** — `HomeScreen` renders `listOfNotNull(favoritesRow) + discoveryRows` under a
   "Discover" header; if empty it falls back to `SearchViewModel.recommendations` (the
   static genre seeds from `assets/qobuz_recommendations.json`). "Recently Played" stays
   below. Each card (`RecommendationCard` in `DiscoveryRowSection`): **artwork/title tap
   → play** (`PlayerViewModel.playUnifiedTrack`); **each credited artist name → that
   artist's page** (`Screen.ArtistDetail.createRoute(id)`) — see "Multiple artists" below.

**Shared mappers** — `domain/usecase/TrackMappers.kt` holds the catalog `Track → UnifiedTrack`
conversions (`toUnifiedTrack` = TIDAL/HiFiApi, `toQobuzUnifiedTrack` = QobuzCached, and
`toUnifiedTrackAuto(registry)` which picks by `QobuzIdRegistry.isQobuzTrack`). Reused by
both `SearchViewModel` and `DiscoveryFeedUseCase`. `UnifiedTrack.artistId: Long?` carries
the primary catalog artist id; `UnifiedTrack.artists: List<UnifiedArtistRef>` carries the
full per-artist credits (see below).

### Multiple artists (per-artist profile navigation)

A track credited to several artists wires **each** name to its own profile.

- **Model** — `UnifiedTrack.artists: List<UnifiedArtistRef(id: Long?, name)>`
  (`domain/model/Models.kt`). `id` is the catalog artist id (null when the source only
  gives a name → shown but not linked). `artistId`/`artistName` remain the single-primary
  convenience view. `TrackMappers.uiArtistRefs()` (public) derives the list from catalog
  `Track.artists` (falling back to the primary `artist`); local tracks get their
  `artistId`/`artists` from `LocalMediaRepository.toUnifiedTrack`.
- **Source data** — TIDAL tracks already carry a full `artists` list with ids. Qobuz
  **track** payloads carry only a single `performer`; the structured multi-artist credits
  live on the **album**, so `HiFiApiClient.QobuzTrackItem.toDomainTrack` merges the
  performer with the album's *performing* credits (`QobuzArtistRef`, role-filtered via
  `isPerformingCredit()` to drop composer/producer-only entries), deduped by id. Qobuz
  free-text `performers` names without ids are **not** resolved (documented limitation).
- **Routing** — `DiscoveryFeedUseCase` registers **every** credited artist id (not just the
  primary) via `QobuzIdRegistry.registerArtist`, so a tapped featured artist resolves
  through `getQobuzArtist` instead of mis-routing to the TIDAL pool on a dual-source setup.
- **UI** — `ui/components/ClickableArtists.kt` is the canonical component: renders each
  credit as a tappable segment (linked when `id != null`, plain label otherwise), falling
  back to a single `artistName` when there are no structured credits. `TrackArtistAlbumLine`
  (same file) is the standard `UnifiedTrack` subtitle: clickable artists + a " • <album>"
  link. Reuse these anywhere a track's artist/album line should route.

### Universal artist + album linking (every track surface)

Tapping any artist name → that artist's page, and the album art/title → that album's page,
on **every** surface that shows a track. The interaction model: row body = play, artist =
artist page, album = album page, long-press = context menu (the discoverable fallback).

- **Central routing** — `ui/navigation/CatalogNav.kt` holds source-aware `NavController`
  extensions: `openArtist(sourceType, id)` (LOCAL → `LocalArtistDetail`, else `ArtistDetail`),
  `openAlbum(albumId)` (parses `"local_album_*"` → `LocalAlbumDetail`, bare numeric →
  `AlbumDetail`, `"col_album_*"`/unknown → no-op), `openCatalogArtist/Album` for domain
  `Track` rows, and `isNavigableAlbumId()`. Routing **branches on `sourceType`** so taps
  never cross TIDAL↔Qobuz↔local namespaces.
- **Shared rows carry it** — `TrackItem` has an `onArtistClick: (Long) -> Unit` and renders
  its artist line via `ClickableArtists`; bespoke `UnifiedTrack` rows use `TrackArtistAlbumLine`.
  Wired surfaces: Home/Discover, Search, Playlist, Library (recently/liked), Album & Artist
  detail, Local songs/album/artist/genre/folder, and the Now-Playing screen (`PlayerTrackInfo`).
- **Never a dead link** — a credit/album with no resolvable id (collection, Qobuz free-text
  performer, downloaded-file entities) renders as plain text. **Out of scope** (no target /
  by design): collection rows (no collection detail screens), the downloads list (entities
  carry no catalog ids), the queue sheet & mini-player (transient/secondary — the full player
  links artists), car mode, and the Glance widget.
