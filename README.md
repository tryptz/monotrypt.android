Tryptify is an audiophile-grade music player whose interesting parts live below the UI. A Jetpack Compose / Material 3 front end sits on top of a native signal-processing core: a 32-processor DSP mixing console, a parametric AutoEQ that synthesises correction filters from published headphone measurements, and a libusb-based driver that writes PCM directly to external DACs — bypassing the Android audio HAL for a bit-perfect path. It plays a local FLAC/lossless library, renders a real-time ProjectM visualizer off the post-DSP stream, and ships as a single installable app.

<sub>Formerly **MonoTrypT**. Application id and on-device storage are unchanged, so existing installs upgrade in place.</sub>

## DSP Mixer

The core is a C++17 native library (`monochrome_dsp`) embedded inside the ExoPlayer audio pipeline. It uses ARM NEON SIMD, denormal flush-to-zero, and lock-free atomic state hand-off so the real-time audio thread never blocks on the UI.

```
ExoPlayer → ReplayGain → AutoEQ / ParamEQ → MixBusProcessor (JNI) → ProjectM tap → AudioSink
                                                  │                                    │
                                            Native DspEngine             ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
                                            ├─ Bus 1  [up to 16 plugins] │  default → DefaultAudioSink
                                            ├─ Bus 2  [up to 16 plugins] │  bypass  → LibusbAudioSink
                                            ├─ Bus 3  [up to 16 plugins] │             (libusb UAC)
                                            ├─ Bus 4  [up to 16 plugins] └───────────────────────────┘
                                            ├─ Sum ──────────────────────┐
                                            └─ Master [up to 16 plugins] ┘
```

Each bus has gain (dB), pan, mute, solo, and input-enable. The master sums active buses, runs its own plugin chain, and meters the output with peak + hold ballistics. Engine state serialises to JSON and persists in Room. User-selectable processing block size (4096 / 8K / 16K).

### The 32 processors

| Category | Processors |
| --- | --- |
| **Utility** | Gain · Stereo (M/S + equal-power pan) · Channel Mixer (2×2 routing) · Haas |
| **EQ & Filter** | Filter (RBJ biquad: LP/BP/HP/Notch/Shelf/Peak, 1×–4× slope) · Comb · Formant · Ladder (Moog/diode, 2× OS) · Nonlinear (SVF + 5 shapers) · Resonator |
| **Dynamics** | Compressor · Limiter (5 ms lookahead, true peak) · Gate · Dynamics (dual-threshold) · Compactor (lookahead limiter/ducker) · Transient Shaper · Trance Gate (8-step ADSR) |
| **Distortion** | Distortion (6 modes) · Shaper (256-pt transfer LUT) · Bitcrush (SR + bit-depth, TPDF dither) · Phase Distortion (Hilbert self-PM) |
| **Modulation** | Chorus · Ensemble · Flanger (barberpole) · Phaser (2–12 stage) · Ring Mod · Tape Stop · Frequency Shifter (SSB via Hilbert pair) · Pitch Shifter (granular OLA) |
| **Space** | Delay (≤2 s, ping-pong, ducking) · Reverb (8-line FDN + 4 allpass diffusers) · Reverser |

Every processor exposes bypass, dry/wet, and 5 ms parameter smoothing. **All setters clamp their inputs and reject non-finite values before they reach the real-time thread**; biquads fall back to passthrough on pathological f/Q combinations rather than producing NaNs.

A separate **Inflator** and **Compressor** (Oxford/Seap-style) are exposed on their own screens, outside the bus plugin chain.

**Shared primitives:** RBJ-cookbook biquads, cubic-interpolated delay lines, peak/RMS envelope followers, LFOs, allpass chains, DC blocker, Hilbert transform, 2× half-band oversampler, lookahead buffers, Hann overlap-add crossfade, and exponential parameter smoothers.

## AutoEQ

A 10-band parametric EQ that generates headphone-correction filters from frequency-response measurements.

**Algorithm — greedy iterative peak-finding:**

1. Normalise the measurement against the target over the 250–2500 Hz midrange window.
2. Scan 20 Hz–16 kHz for the worst deviation (sub-50 Hz weighted 1.2×).
3. Invert that deviation as gain (clamped ±12 dB, ±8 dB above 8 kHz) and estimate Q from the bandwidth.
4. Subtract the new filter's biquad response from the remaining error.
5. Repeat up to 10 bands, stopping early once max error < 0.05 dB.

**Target curves:** Harman Over-Ear 2018 · Harman In-Ear 2019 · Diffuse Field · Knowles · Moondrop VDSF · Flat, plus several house targets.

**Measurement sources** — twelve squig.link instances are queried in parallel on first fetch and the published AutoEq catalog is bundled; per-source failures are silent so one dead host can't poison the list (24 h cache TTL). Each measurement is tagged by the **rig** it was captured on (B&K 5128, GRAS 43AG-7 / 43AC-10 / 45CA-10, IEC-711 clone, MiniDSP EARS, Uploaded, Unknown), and the picker re-filters by rig instantly with no network round-trip.

**Custom measurements** — CSV/TXT with auto-detected delimiter, header detection, and European-decimal handling; the imported curve is cached so it survives across sessions.

**Audio integration** — the EQ processor wraps Android's system `Equalizer` effect bound to the ExoPlayer session. Parametric bands are projected onto the device's fixed system bands with a Gaussian gain-estimation model, gains clamp to the hardware's millibel limits, and a preamp clamps against peak band gain to protect headroom. Updates are read via an atomic snapshot per audio block — no clicks during live tweaking.

## USB-DAC bit-perfect output

A libusb-backed Audio Class driver that takes the streaming interface from the kernel and writes PCM straight to the DAC's isochronous endpoint, bypassing the Android audio HAL.

**Owns:** one process-wide libusb context; a device handle wrapping a Java-supplied `UsbDeviceConnection` fd; streaming-interface alt-setting selection + claim (plus an AudioControl-interface claim so `SET_CUR` reaches the device); a preallocated pool of isochronous transfers; a single-producer/single-consumer ring buffer the audio thread fills and the iso-completion callback drains; and an event thread driving `libusb_handle_events`.

**Negotiates:** UAC1 *and* UAC2, auto-detected from the descriptors (UAC1 covers devices like the Focal Bathys that don't speak UAC2). Sample rate is resolved via the UAC2 clock entity and `GET_RANGE`, walking Selector → Source units as needed; alts whose max packet size can't fit the configured rate are rejected up front.

**Pacing:** a UAC2 asynchronous-feedback endpoint reader gives sample-accurate iso scheduling; UAC1 falls back to fixed-rate pacing.

**Sink integration:** `LibusbAudioSink` is a Media3 `ForwardingAudioSink` wrapping a `DefaultAudioSink`. When bypass is hot it runs the *same* `AudioProcessor` chain (mixer DSP, AutoEQ, parametric EQ, FFT spectrum, ProjectM tap) and then writes the post-DSP PCM to libusb. Software volume follows the hardware keys; pause silences the DAC instantly; a **watchdog with a short grace window falls back to the delegate sink if the iso pump wedges**.

**Failure surfacing:** start failures are categorised — *no-device, no-matching-alt, claim-failed, set-alt-failed, sample-rate-failed, iso-pump-alloc/submit-failed* — and surfaced to Settings as actionable text instead of one boilerplate string.

## Building

**Requirements:** Android Studio (Ladybug or newer), JDK 17, and the Android NDK + CMake (installed via the SDK Manager). The native dependencies (libusb, ProjectM) are vendored as git submodules under `third_party/`.

```bash
# clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tryptz/Tryptify.git
cd Tryptify
# or, if already cloned:
git submodule update --init --recursive

# debug build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# install on a connected device
./gradlew installDebug
```

For release builds, copy `keystore.properties.example` to `keystore.properties` and fill in your signing config. Prebuilt APKs are on the [Releases page](https://github.com/tryptz/Tryptify/releases/latest) (Android 8.0+, sideload or `adb install`).

> On a fresh install the visualizer assets load on first launch (usually a few seconds) — if Android shows an ANR dialog, choose **Wait**.

## Reliability & diagnostics

A few deliberate choices keep a real-time audio app from failing silently on real hardware:

- **Real-time safety** — every DSP setter clamps its range and rejects non-finite input before the audio thread sees it; biquads degrade to passthrough on bad coefficients instead of emitting NaNs.
- **Bypass watchdog** — if the USB iso pump stalls, a watchdog with a short grace window automatically falls back to the standard Android audio sink so playback never dead-ends.
- **Categorised errors** — USB start-up failures map to specific, actionable causes surfaced in Settings rather than a generic message.
- **Source isolation** — optional/secondary subsystems are wrapped so a single failure (a dead measurement host, a missing tag) is logged and dropped without taking down playback.
