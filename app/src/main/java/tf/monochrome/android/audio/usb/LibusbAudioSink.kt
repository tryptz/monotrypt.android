/**
 * Media3 [AudioSink] that hands PCM directly to libusb when the user
 * has Exclusive USB DAC mode on AND the iso pump is live; otherwise
 * delegates to whatever sink the caller passed in.
 *
 * The choice of delegate is made once at renderer-build time by
 * [tf.monochrome.android.player.PlaybackService.buildAudioSink]:
 *
 *  - **Exclusive ON** → `delegate` is a [NoOpAudioSink]. No
 *    `AudioTrack` is ever created. The libusb iso pump owns the USB
 *    streaming interface alone. Bypass-or-nothing semantics: if the
 *    iso pump can't engage (e.g. driver.start fails), the NoOp
 *    swallows audio → silence, and the user sees the failure reason
 *    in the Settings status card. Better than fighting the bus with
 *    an AudioTrack the kernel can't honor (which produced the
 *    "KKDDRDRRDRRDLDLLDLLD" stutter that motivated this design).
 *  - **Exclusive OFF** → `delegate` is a real [DefaultAudioSink]
 *    with the full processor chain. AudioTrack handles output via
 *    AudioFlinger.
 *
 * Switching between the two requires a full ExoPlayer rebuild
 * (`buildAudioSink` runs once per player build, not per prepare).
 * Currently we don't do that automatically — the toggle change takes
 * effect at next app start. A live-rebuild watcher is a viable
 * follow-up if the UX bites; the design is intentionally kept
 * simple here because the previous attempts at hot-swap delegates
 * reintroduced exactly the dual-AudioTrack contention bug we're
 * fixing.
 *
 * Honest scope:
 *  - When bypass is hot, the sink runs the same AudioProcessor chain
 *    that DefaultAudioSink would (mixBus DSP, AutoEQ, parametric EQ,
 *    spectrum FFT) inline via [AudioProcessorChain], then writes the
 *    post-DSP PCM to libusb. ProjectM tap is intentionally excluded
 *    from the bypass chain (visualizer bus can block its consumer
 *    and we can't pay that cost on the renderer thread).
 *  - getCurrentPositionUs uses played-frames accounting from
 *    [LibusbUacDriver.playedFrames], including silence padding —
 *    that's intentional so the renderer doesn't see "sink stalled"
 *    during legitimate underrun pads.
 *  - Playback speed has no audible effect while exclusive is on.
 *    The DefaultAudioSink path uses SonicAudioProcessor internally
 *    for time-stretch; we don't include it in the bypass chain.
 *    [NoOpAudioSink.setPlaybackParameters] still round-trips the
 *    user's value so ExoPlayer's state machine is satisfied — but
 *    the iso pump only knows how to write at the source rate. Speed
 *    slider works again when the user toggles exclusive off.
